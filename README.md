# Google Books Search

## Description

Google Books Search is an app that allows the user to search any book they desire. The data is dynamically populated, and for a book to appear, it has to be searched by title. When a title is submitted, various books with the similar name will populate. Every book is accompanied by an image of the cover, the name of the author, and a brief description. The user will the have the option to click on the `Visit Link` in case they would like the purchase the book. A `Save` button is also available that will store a number of books in the `Saved` page.
In the next page, the user will see the books that have been saved. Along with the `Visit Link` button, ther is also a `Delete` button, so the book can easily be deleted from the list.
